Localytics integration for [analytics-android](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-android).

## Installation

To install the Segment-Localytics integration, simply add this line to your gradle file: 

```
compile 'com.segment.analytics.android:analytics-integration-localytics:+'
```

Since Localytics does not publish to Maven Central, you will also need to add the Maven Localytics repo. 

```
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
  maven { url 'http://maven.localytics.com/public' }
}
```

## Usage

Next, register the integration with our SDK.  To do this, import the Localytics integration:


```
import com.segment.analytics.internal.integrations.LocalyticsIntegration;

```

And add the following line:

```
analytics = new Analytics.Builder(this, "write_key")
                .use(LocalyticsIntegration.FACTORY)
                .build();
```
